It is a one-stop platform to automate vacation planning starting from planning for vacation destination, search for best possible transportation solution till hotel booking. We use data mining tool, mahout library - Item collaborative filtering to build the recommendation system. Mahout data mining library is widely used in many tech company for big data projects. We use this data mining tool to calculate similarity score of travel destination that user have been to against those user has yet visited. Rank travel destination option base on similarity score. Yelp offers a large dataset for the public. We took advantage of this dataset by applying data mining analysis for this recommendation system. In this project, we make use of open source tools and technologies like mahout data mining library, no sql database MongoDB, Java-Jersey to build Restful API interface, CSS, HTML5, JavaScript, and popular search api such as Google Maps, Facebook, Yelp, Yahoo and etc.
